# Advent of Code

## Solutions
My AoC Solutions, mostly in JS

## Downloader
Also includes a node-based boilerplate generator/input downloader

To use the downloader, run `npm i` and save your AoC session cookie in ./session (check your logged-in browser requests to obtain it)

Please note that the test case is not explicitly marked as such on the webpage and must be inferred. As a heuristic, the downloader simply uses the contents of the first `<pre>` block of the day page, which can fail.

Usage: node start [day] [year]
